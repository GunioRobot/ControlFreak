This is WORK IN PROGRESS - The base works but is poorly documented,
and it's not usable other than for testing, please if you are not
a hacker, wait a few days. :)

I'm still hacking on it.
The documentation for the basic feature set is pretty
much there though.

INSTALLATION

ControlFreak installation is straightforward. If your CPAN shell is set up,
you should just be able to do

    % cpan ControlFreak

Download it, unpack it, then build it as per the usual:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make && make test

Then install it:

    % make install

DOCUMENTATION

ControlFreak documentation is available as in POD. So you can do:

    % perldoc ControlFreak

to read the documentation online with your favorite pager.
